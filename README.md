3. It will take a while, wait for download

4. After that, open the folder and run in vs code:
	1. type "cd Folder_Name"
	2. type "code ."

5. You run ur code on app.js

Note: It is best you safe ur progress code on Github, because you can only run and code on App.js, renaming them may cause complications

To run on expo app, open terminal, and scan qr code
